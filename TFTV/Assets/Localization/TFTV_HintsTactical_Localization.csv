In TFTV, the Umbra can spawn in place of a dead Arthron or Triton with the <b>Touched by the Void</b> ability, which they have a chance to roll at the start of each complete turn. The chance to roll is the total amount of Delirium of all your operatives on the mission divided by two.

The Umbra can only attack characters with Delirium or characters in contact with the Mist, but they can be attacked by all characters.",,"<i>""On dit qu'une Ombre ne fait pas que vous tuer : elle vous vole votre âme.""</i>

Dans TFTV, l'Ombre apparaîtra à la place d'un Arthron ou d'un Triton avec la capacité <b>Touché par le Néant</b>, lorsque il meurt. Ils ont une chance au début de chaque tour complet, de faire un jet contre le montant total de Délire de tous vos agents engagés sur la mission divisé par deux.

This Pandoran is special. After it is attacked, it is very likely to gain a special ability (however, there is a small chance that it will be passed by the Void and lose its Touch, gaining nothing). At first, the only ability it may gain is to spawn an Umbra version of itself on death.
