Terror from the Void is an overhaul mod for Phoenix Point. If you think "Long War" you are right.

REQUIRES ALL DLC

DO NOT USE BETTER ENEMIES OR BETTER VEHICLES AS BOTH ARE ALREADY INTEGRATED IN THE MOD.

This is an Open Beta/Early Access. Expect bugs and balance issues. More below.

- Items, weapons and Skills rebalance (also part of Better Classes)
- Major rework of almost every DLC

OPEN BETA

The Beta is feature complete for version 1.0 of the development. But some features are still unfinished because we are not certain which direction to take them. As such we really need your feedback about everything.

Take note, that this mod changes the game A LOT and we expect you to play one difficulty level below your preferred setting as you learn the ropes. If you play LEGEND do not complain the game is too difficult or unfair.

WARNING

TftV is NOT COMPATIBLE with any 3rd party mods that modify or meddle with: 
- Skills and everything related to your soldier classes
- UI, especially personel screen and geoscape objectives
- Research
- Aircraft cost, seats and everything related
- DLCs (in any way)
- Max # of augmentations 

TLDR: Any mods besides cosmetics are highly likely to cause problems.
