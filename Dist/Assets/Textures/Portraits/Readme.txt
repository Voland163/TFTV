You can now add your own custom portraits to replace the in-game renders in tactical!

How it works:

1) When the Geoscape is loaded, the game checks the customization options chosen for each of your operatives.
2) It checks the filename of the available portraits to find the most matching pic for the operative.
3) When a Tactical map is loaded, the game will use the assigned pic for the portrait instead of the render.

How to add/replace portraits:

1) Open one of the provided custom portraits to use as a template, and replace the pic with one of your choosing.
2) Save it as a new filename in the folder using the following code, separating each parameter with a _:

a) Sex: m for male, f for female.
b) Race: 1 = African, 2 = Asian, 3 = Caucasian, 4 = Hispanic
c) Face type/age: 1, 2, 3 
d) Hair style: 1-16 
e) Facial hair style: 1-16
f) Hair color: 1-10

You can choose the right parameters for a character by looking at it in the customization screen ingame.
Please note that game uses a single number for b) and c), calling it "Head". 
So 1-3 is African, 4-6 is Asian, 7-9 is Caucasian, 10-12 is Hispanic.
For example, a male Head 8 in the customization screen will be Caucasian (2) and Face type (2) (codded as m_3_2)
and a female Head 12 will be Hispanic (4) and Face type 3 (codded as f_4_3).

Because there are so many possible combinations in the absence of a complete match, the mod will look for most matching filename, giving higher score to the first parameters and lowest to last. 

Feel free to share your coolest custom Portraits on our Discord server, so that others may use them!
