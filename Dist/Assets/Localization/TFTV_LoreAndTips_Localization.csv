TFTV_LORE_ALISTAIR_TITLE,Text,,Alistair Ashby,,,,,,,,
TFTV_LORE_ALISTAIR_DESCRIPTION,Text,,"Sometimes Alistair thought that the transformative effect of the Pandoravirus on him could not have been greater had he actually been infected with it.

Alistair went from a youthful college-dropout influencer to a bona fide expert, all by taking the first Mist stories seriously, while the rest of the media still considered them fake news. He grasped the significance of what was happening earlier and better than anyone else. He anticipated the Third World War and its consequences, including the rise of the highly polarized and ideologically charged factions, and the demise of race, wealth, nationality and family prestige as relevant sociological factors.

“We are mistaken about the coming Apocalypse. It’s not about extinction or survival. It’s about our place in the new food chain.”

The Pandoravirus also brought Alistair into contact with the child prodigy Olena Kim. They ran into each other more than two decades ago and have been inseparable ever since, to the extent that Alistair now considers himself her oppa (older brother).

The connection - if any - between Alistair and Phoenix Project remains a mystery, but it seems like he knew Randolph Symes III personally.",,,,,,,,
TFTV_LORE_OLENA_TITLE,Text,,Olena Kim,,,,,,,,
TFTV_LORE_OLENA_DESCRIPTION,Text,,"Olena was born in Odesa to a Korean father and a Ukrainian mother, both renowned scholars in archaeology and anthropology. They traveled around the world with their daughter, exposing her to different cultures and languages. A prodigy, Olena bears the imprint of a program for the gifted: an alien within her own species.

She lost her parents during the First Mist. When Alistair Ashby and his band of refugees found her, she was another shell shocked child. In time, he became her friend and confidant, one of the few people who understood her.

Olena never talks about her past unless asked directly. She prefers to focus on the present and future challenges. She is loyal to Alistair and respects his judgment, particularly as to people. She is curious about the various factions but wary of their intentions or agendas.",,,,,,,,
TFTV_LORE_HELENA_TITLE,Text,,Helena Lewandowski,,,,,,,,
TFTV_LORE_HELAN_DESCRIPTION,Text,,"Helena Lewandowski was born in Warsaw, Poland, in 1993. She had a passion for history and archaeology since she was a child, and pursued her studies at the University of Warsaw. She became one of the world’s leading experts on prehistoric cultures and civilizations, especially those that existed before the last ice age. 

In 2019, she joined Project Glory, a secretive attempt to study the nature of enigmatic ruins that predated Homo Sapiens. Project Glory was funded by the Phoenix Project and Vanadium Inc., and was led by Dr. Randolph Symes III, the director of the Phoenix Project at that time.

However, Dr. Symes did not share her enthusiasm or vision. Helena left Project Glory and joined Vanadium Inc., where she continued her research under the supervision of Tobias West, the CEO of Vanadium Inc. In 2022, when the Pandora virus began to spread across the globe, Helena uncovered evidence of an ancient civilization that had advanced technology and knowledge beyond anything known to modern humans. She contacted West and told him about her breakthrough.

However, West suddenly shut down Project Glory and ordered Helena to return to New Jericho’s headquarters. She was later transferred to a prison facility, where she remained until rescued by the Phoenix Project. ",,,,,,,,
