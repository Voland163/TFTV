TFTV_INCIDENT_29_OUTCOME_0_SUCCESS,Text,Reward: Extra personnel,"For the warden the transfers appear to be a bureaucratic obligation—tedious, poorly explained, and outside her core responsibilities.

Every transfer destination is the same: [RequirementHavenName], a New Jericho haven that houses a research complex and an advanced training facility."
TFTV_INCIDENT_29_OUTCOME_1_SUCCESS,Text,Reward: Extra personnel,"Conversations with staff yield little; most repeat the official explanation without comment.

The children, however, speak more freely.

Some talk in hushed, excited tones about a place they call the Royal Stables at [RequirementHavenName].

They describe better food, cleaner quarters, and a special training program.

Their tone is reverent, almost awed."
TFTV_INCIDENT_29_OUTCOME_0_FAIL,Text,,"The files are sparse and poorly organized.

Large portions of the warden’s correspondence appear to have been archived automatically, beyond Phoenix’s reach.

They insist that Phoenix has no jurisdiction over internal child welfare decisions.

The wards fall silent, watching carefully to see who is listening.

Whatever rumors exist retreat further out of reach."
