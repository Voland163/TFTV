KEY_EXPENDABLE_ARCHETYPE_FORMER_PX_DESCRIPTION,Text,,"This mercenary was employed in the Phoenix Point security detail before the cataclysm, and still proudly carries an older pattern of our gear, now a little worse-for-wear after several years without proper maintenance. When you speak with them they tell you that they had no idea that the project had survived. They are dismissive of suggestions that they join back up with the cause, but mention casually that you would be very welcome to take them on at their standard rates. Plus hazard pay of course.",,,,,,,,
KEY_EXPENDABLE_ARCHETYPE_FORMER_PX_QUOTE,Text,,"<i>“We already tried to save the world once, and everyone I worked with died. It’s naive to think that everything can be overcome with grit and best intentions. Sometimes you just have to escape, survive, and reassess your priorities.”</i>",,,,,,,,
KEY_EXPENDABLE_ARCHETYPE_SECTARIAN_NAME,Text,,Sectarian (Berserker),,,,,,,,
KEY_EXPENDABLE_ARCHETYPE_SECTARIAN_DESCRIPTION,Text,,"This savage fighter belongs to a group of secular sceptics that tore away from the religious teachings of the Anu cult at an early stage in its development, disgusted by its dogmatism. They went on to found their own secretive warrior societies, and make heavy use of hallucinogenic drugs to induce terrifying frenzies on the battlefield. Their numbers have grown since, and they are well known and respected in the bandit settlements, where their heavy axes are symbols of ferocity and suicidal bravery. When you approach them in the bar they grin, and lazily point you to their rates.",,,,,,,,
KEY_EXPENDABLE_ARCHETYPE_SECTARIAN_QUOTE,Text,,"<i>“Life is very precious, you know? You can’t just sacrifice what’s in your soul for people who don’t care whether you live or die. There’s no place in this world for cowards.” </i>",,,,,,,,

KEY_EXPENDABLE_ARCHETYPE_GHOST_DESCRIPTION,Text,,"You hear about them before you see one, and everyone has heard the stories. It was supposed to be a clandestine Synedrion programme, experimenting with shared lucid dreaming, controlled exposure to mist, and other para-physical phenomena, but you have never heard any firm agreement around what these experiments were hoping to achieve. Some say they were trying to develop truly unmediated human closeness and empathy; all that is known for sure is that they managed to escape together, that they live as refugees in the bandit towns, and that they are uniformly unstable. You don’t see this one blink once during the negotiations.",,,,,,,,

KEY_EXPENDABLE_ARCHETYPE_SLUG_NAME,Text,,Slug (Technician),,,,,,,,
KEY_EXPENDABLE_ARCHETYPE_SLUG_DESCRIPTION,Text,,"These mutants are the result of invasive and unsafe treatments against mist exposure. With a mixture of controlled mutation and mechanical restraining armatures, they have managed to keep their personalities intact, but many of them live in pain and most are dissociative at best. They often hire themselves out as haven guards and technical specialists, in order to raise funds that they use to ‘save’ more victims of the mist. They are generally seen in the mutant ghettoes, but this particular soldier has approached you directly and asked about being hired on.",,,,,,,,

KEY_EXPENDABLE_ARCHETYPE_SPYMASTER_NAME,Text,,Spymaster (Infiltrator),,,,,,,,
KEY_EXPENDABLE_ARCHETYPE_SPYMASTER_DESCRIPTION,Text,,"This is one of the infiltrators that work for the rulers of the bandit encampments. These are the  men and women who actually undertake the high-risk sabotage and infiltration missions against the factions, and who stock the bazaar with its more exotic wares. They are also capable and ruthless enforcers and assassins, and their skills make them excellent mercenaries, hired out when their masters are in need of cash. They smile when you approach, and tell you that all the particulars can be finalised on the flight.

KEY_EXPENDABLE_ARCHETYPE_DOOM_DESCRIPTION,Text,,"This old soldier is one of the few surviving members of a loose collection of powerful military outfits who fought alongside New Jericho in the years before the collapse. Their gear is ancient and in bad need of repair, and their outdated and poorly-maintained military implants cause them constant pain, which often makes them aggressive and confused, evidenced in trophy-taking and other unethical behaviour. Despite this, you are talking to an experienced veteran and a powerful warrior, who is well accustomed to the rigours of mercenary work.",,,,,,,,
KEY_EXPENDABLE_ARCHETYPE_DOOM_QUOTE,Text,,"<i>“The fight changes over time… You get a sense of what people are worth over time as well… Get a sense of who is worth your trust, worth your allegiance, and of who you and your guys you should just quietly frag as soon as you see an opportunity…”</i>",,,,,,,,

KEY_EXPENDABLE_ARCHETYPE_EXILE_DESCRIPTION,Text,,"This is an ex-Synedrion wetwork specialist, whose unorthodox theoretical and political convictions led to them voluntarily abandoning their commune-haven. This is more common than people outside of Synedrion often realise - radical freedom must also include the freedom to leave. Exiles often turn to employment as security professionals, work that allows them to remain consistent to their often eccentric understandings of how one ought to live. This one keeps discussion strictly professional, ignoring questions that don’t pertain to the job: expectations, contracts, perks, and day rates.",,,,,,,,
