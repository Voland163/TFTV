The asteroid hit deep inside a quarantine zone, where the Pandoravirus has aggressively mutated the surrounding ecology. However, traces of seismic activity have been detected in faraway coastal regions, coinciding with rumors of Pandoran hordes emerging from the mist.",,,,,,,,

KEY_FS_ALN_CORRUPTION_NODE_RESEARCHDEF_COMPLETE,Text,,"Species classification CN-Alpha
A highly evolved form of the Pandoravirus has been reported to attack human settlements by attaching itself to structures and machinery to form a powerful symbiotic connection. Affected havens are completely overtaken by the creature and all of their citizens are kept in a mindless state serving the Pandorans.
Recent reports indicate Nodes are able to establish a similar telepathic connection with AI-operated aircraft and use it to attack other humans. Despite the evidence of high intelligence, no attempt at peaceful contact with the creature has been successful yet.",,,,,,,,
KEY_FS_PX_ALIEN_CORRUPTION_NODE_RESEARCHDEF_COMPLETE,Text,,"Summary: What we have uncovered is deeply troubling. It is certain that the Node is not created through genetic aggregation and manipulation, either via cloning or aggressively mutating a live subject, as are all the other Pandoran species that we have encountered so far. Biologically, it is nothing but a random collection of cells: we are at a loss as to how it is even able to maintain a coherent shape. What we have autopsied is little more than a broken vessel that was previously inhabited by something that left no trace of itself upon leaving it.

We are only left with the esoteric as a plausible explanation: the Node must be a physical manifestation of the Oneiric Delirium; it is quite literally the product of nightmares. We hypothesize that a Pandoran creature with telepathic ability provoked a massive OD event at the haven and that brought the Node into being. We can further hypothesize that this required a substantial amount of biomass and a period of time. Once the Node appeared, it took over the haven and everything and everyone in it at the time: the unfortunate inhabitants were somehow used to invoke the intelligence that subdued them.

Genetic origins: none

Function: unknown

Offensive capabilities: Takes over and controls entire human settlements and technology, including aircraft. We speculate that the creature is somehow harnessing the Oneiric Delirium phenomenon. Should this speculation prove correct, the fact that the creature's control extends to inanimate objects such as terrestrial and aerial vehicles would have tremendous implications for our understanding of this phenomenon.

Defensive capabilities: Spreads viral agents around its body to fend off attackers.

Mobility: Once attached, the body remains completely immobile.

Weakness: It seems to have a one-sided telepathic connection with its victims. Once the body is dead, all mind-control connection with all entities is broken.",,,,,,,,

PROG_FS20_TEXT_GENERAL_0,Text,,"It is clear that the Behemoth and the swarm of flying creatures arose out of the interaction between the asteroid and the Pandoran ecosystem.

We have to treat the Behemoth as a viral strain, rather than a <i>kanji</i>. We need some sort of antibodies and a method of delivering them. We will come up with something, as we always do. But we must keep shooting down the flying cephalopods in the meantime.",,,,,,,,
